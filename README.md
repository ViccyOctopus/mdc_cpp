# mdc_cpp
Used for Miami Dade Wolfson's C++ Class.

1. Define What the program is to do
2. Visualize the program running on the computer.
3. Use deisgn tools to create a model of the program.
4. Check the model for logical errors.
5. Type the code, save it, and compile it.
6. Correct any errors found during compilation. Repeat steps 5 and 6 if needed.
7. Run the program with test data for input.
8. Correct any errors found while running the program. Repeat steps 5 through 8 as many times as necessary.
9. Validate the results of the program.

Funky way of coding C++ on Windows:

Cant use gitbash for opening program, must use Developer Console. (use cd c:\ for highest level)
When creating a new file:
    1. Save the file as .cpp, create folder for said project/file.
    2. Terminal in VSC -> Run Build Task
        a. This creates new files to support the C++ file.
        b. Must do this for every addition, removal, save, etc..
    3. Run the program (without debugging)

Can still use gitbash for git commands, but not opening the program
